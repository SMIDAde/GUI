[List of Documentation Files](menu.md)

See [Methods](METHODS.md) for selection of Features.

There are different systems do use the features in SMIDA.

Either by directly calling specific functions or by providing the feature names in a `feature_dict` to a general function.

The features are calculated in `schau_mir_in_die_augen/feature_extraction.py`
The features are defined in `schau_mir_in_die_augen/features.py`

During runtime the features are cached by the `memory` package.
